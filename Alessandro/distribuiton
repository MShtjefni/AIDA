For the distribution analysis I use the manufacturing dataset with 1.027.140 records. I have tested 10 different distribution with the fitdist library. For the first semple I used 700.000 records for manufacturing.
-----  NORMAL DISTRIBUTION  -----
- EMPLOYE: AIC = 8.996.060. The sample mean is in the quantile center. We can't rejectd the null'hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05/0.01. The sample sd is in the quantile center. We can't rejectd the null'hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05/0.01
-REVENUE : AIC = 18.013.359. The sample mean is in the quantile center. We can't rejected the null hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05.

------ LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION -----
- EMPLOYEE: AIC =  5.092.524 . The sample mean is in the quantile center. We can't rejectd the null'hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05/0.01. The sample sd is in the quantile center. We can't rejectd the null'hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05/0.01
- REVENUE: AIC = 12.113.658.In this case p.value<0.05 and the sample mean and sd aren't in the quantile center.

------ GAMMA DISTRIBUTION --------
- EMPLOYEE : AIC = 5.472.443. The sample mean is in the quantile center. We can't rejected the null hypotesis but the p.value is <0.05.
- REVENUE:
