This project consists of a <b>Statistical purpose analysis on the Italian firms</b>, it borns with an educational aim for the 
[Statistical Methods for Data Science](http://didawiki.cli.di.unipi.it/doku.php/mds/smd/start) course(A.Y. 2017-2018) 
at the Universit√† di Pisa.
We've been analyzing Italian firms by trying to answer very common claims in the economical/statistical field, that are:
- what's the measure of size that best describes the firms size;
- quantifying the correlation between different measures of the firms size;
- how are the firms sizes distributed;
- how is the firms growth distributed;
- is the mean growth statistically different from zero;
- is the growth distribution symmetric or asymmetric.

Then we've also tried to distinguish the behaviours within distinct subsamples of the whole dataset, such as: distinct subsectors, distinct years, distinct firms sizes.

All the analysis have been done with <b>R</b>
